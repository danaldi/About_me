# Hi!
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a perpetually curious student who loves tinkering with tech! Whether it's diving into the world of Machine Learning, exploring the depths of Cybersecurity or weaving the web with my Web Development skills, I'm always eager to learn and try out new things.

You can find all my tech projects dumped here on Github - consider it my digital playground! ðŸ’» From goofy little experiments to full-blown projects, I've got a bit of everything here. So come on in, take a look around, and don't be afraid to get your hands dirty! ðŸ˜‰
